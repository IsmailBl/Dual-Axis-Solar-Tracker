# Dual-Axis-Solar-Tracker

## Overview

This project is a solar tracker system implemented with Arduino, designed to orient a solar panel towards the direction of maximum sunlight. The system utilizes light sensors and servo motors to achieve solar tracking, maximizing energy production from solar cells.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following software installed:

- Fritzing for the electrical schematics
- Arduino IDE with the following libraries:
	- Wire
	- LiquidCrystal_I2C
	- Servo

## Installation

1. Download and install Fritzing for visualizing the electrical schematics.
2. Install the Arduino IDE along with the required libraries.
3. Wire the Arduino as shown in the schematics files.
4. Upload the Solar_Tracker_Code to the Arduino board.

## Usage

1. Ensure all the necessary software and libraries are properly installed.
2. Connect the Arduino to the solar panel system.
3. Utilize the Solar Monitor app (included in the files) to visualize the energy production data from the Arduino.
4. Connect your phone to the Arduino board using the HC-05 Bluetooth module.
