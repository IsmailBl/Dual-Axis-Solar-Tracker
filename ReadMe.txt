
**1st you will have to download this softwares so can visualize the coding 
as well as the schematics and be able to compile them adequatly

Required Softwares :
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Electrical part 	: -Fritzing
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Programming IDE		: -Arduino IDE & The following libraries:
					*Wire
					*LiquidCrystal_I2C
					*Servo
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**2nd After downloading all the necessary libraries and softwares you should install them, wire the arduino as
shown in the schematics files and finally upload the Solar_Tracker_Code

**In order to visualize data coming from arduino, which in this case is energy production
of your solar cell you'll need to install the Solar monitor app that i've sent you within the files.

**Afterwards you 'll need to connect your phone to the arduino board through the Bluetooth protocole
and the use of HC-05 Module.
 
**Thank you
